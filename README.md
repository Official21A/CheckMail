# CheckMail
Using simple python library to create a program to check your emails.

# Disctiption
Using IMAP library to read the emails of your gmail account.

The library is in python standard libraries, so you don't need to install anything.

If you use different email servers you need to change the end syntax and the domain name 
and also the useing port.

This program needs IMAP activation in your gmail account, otherwise it could not access your mails.
Just be carefull in using this app, cause you need to enter your password manually.
